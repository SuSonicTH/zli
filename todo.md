# FullMoon

# fixes

# improvements of compilation
* generate lua source libryry header in buld (luaunit.lua , re.lua) instead of having it in repo

# additional libraries
* cleanup & include zip/unzip
* json library
* http server/client 
* tar library
* terminal ui library, either some existing lua binding or own based on https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses
* gui library https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear with wraper or https://www.raylib.com/ 

maybe add some of https://github.com/nothings/single_file_libs or https://github.com/nothings/stb https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/links/libs with a lua wraper
